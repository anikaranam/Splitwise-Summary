# Splitwise-Summary
This project aims to provide an overview of your splitwise expenses by providing a detailed breakdown of your expenses and providing some metrics
that are otherwise only available through the Splitwise Paid account. Using this feature, you can get a more general idea of the kind of expenses that you are occurring and
budget for them accordingly.
